# Rust Simple Interpreter

This is my take on going through the "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter" tutorial
(which starts at https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/).

I will make my own set of changes throughout the guide.

I plan to have several git branches in this repository, which could be used to
answer the end-of-part questions posed by the author.

I will use Rust as the host language.
